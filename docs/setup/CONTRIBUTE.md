# Contribute to the MkDocs TDT

We welcome feedback. We are a small team who work on this template alongside other responsibilities, and appreciate any contributions to help us further develop and improve it. If you would like to contribute to this template, raise an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/mkdocs-tech-docs-template/issues). One of us will review and get back to you.

We also welcome new feature requests but cannot always accommodate them. We utilise the functionality that the [Material for MkDocs theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) provides and try not to build on top of it; however, MkDocs does have an [ecosystem of plugins](../README.md) that provide additional functionality to your documentation site.

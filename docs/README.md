# MkDocs Tech Docs Template

!!! danger ""

    This template is under construction and should only be used for prototyping

The MkDocs Tech Docs Template is an [MkDocs theme](https://www.mkdocs.org/) that you can use to build technical documentation with a GOV.UK style. For a demo visit [mkdocs-tech-docs-template](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/mkdocs-tech-docs-template/).

The MkDocs Tech Docs Template is a python-based alternative to the ruby-based Middleman [Tech Docs Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template) with the following benefits:

- simple to setup, use and customise
- exploits the [MkDocs Materials theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and all it's associated features
- compatible with the vast and growing ecosystem of [MkDocs Plugins](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Plugins) see [plugins](plugins/) for some examples
- unified tech stack for python-based teams and projects
- easy to upgrade as new versions of the theme are released

You’re welcome to use the MkDocs Tech Docs Template even if your service isn’t considered part of GOV.UK, but your site or service must not:

- identify itself as being part of GOV.UK
- use the crown or GOV.UK logotype in the header
- use the GDS Transport typeface
- suggest that it’s an official UK government website if it’s not

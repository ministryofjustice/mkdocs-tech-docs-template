# Introduction

!!! danger ""

    This template is under construction and should only be used for prototyping

The MkDocs Tech Docs Template is an [MkDocs theme](https://www.mkdocs.org/) that you can use to build technical documentation with a GOV.UK style. For a demo visit [mkdocs-tech-docs-template](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/mkdocs-tech-docs-template/).

The MkDocs Tech Docs Template is a python-based alternative to the ruby-based Middleman [Tech Docs Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template) with the following benefits:

- simple to setup, use and customise
- exploits the [MkDocs Materials theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and all it's associated features
- compatible with the vast and growing ecosystem of [MkDocs Plugins](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Plugins)
- unified tech stack for python-based teams and projects
- easy to upgrade as new versions of the theme are released

Youâ€™re welcome to use the MkDocs Tech Docs Template even if your service isnâ€™t considered part of GOV.UK, but your site or service must not:

- identify itself as being part of GOV.UK
- use the crown or GOV.UK logotype in the header
- use the GDS Transport typeface
- suggest that itâ€™s an official UK government website if itâ€™s not

## Usage

You are encouraged to read the Material for MkDocs [getting started](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) pages before proceeding.

### Quick Start

MkDocs Tech Docs template is published as a Python package and can be installed with pip, ideally by using a virtual environment. Open up a terminal and install with:

```
pip install mkdocs-tech-docs-template
```

Bootstrap your project documentation:

```
mkdocs new .
```

This creates the following structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€ docs/
â”‚  â””â”€ index.md
â””â”€ mkdocs.yml
```

### Customisation

Update/add the following variables in `mkdocs.yml`:

```
- site_name: <website-name>
- repo_url: <url>
- theme:
  - name: tech_docs_template
```

To use your department's images:

- add the images to the `docs/assets` directory in your repository
- replace the logo and favicon file name in the `mkdocs.yml` file
- consider adding the images to the template for sharing with colleagues

For additional customisation, please refer to MkDocs Material [instructions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/customization/).

### Preview

MkDocs includes a live preview server, so you can preview your changes as you write your documentation. The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving. Start it with:

``` sh
mkdocs serve
```

### Publish

You can use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate the deployment of your documentation to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) when a commit is pushed to either the master or main branches. 

See [publishing your site](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/) for more details and alternatives.

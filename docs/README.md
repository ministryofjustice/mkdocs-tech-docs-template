#MKDocs Tech Docs Template

!!! banner "Build flexible technical documentation with a [GOV.UK style][gov.ukStyle]"

    ![Services][homepage_illustration]{ align=right width=300px height=300px}

    The **MKdocs Tech Docs Template** is a Python-based alternative to the ruby-based [Tech Docs Template][TDT] with the following benefits:

    - easy to [set up][setup], [customise][customise] and [enhance][contribute]
    - utilises the [MkDocs Materials theme][material] and its associated features
    - compatible with the vast ecosystem of MkDocs [plugins][plugins]
    - unified tech stack for Python-based teams and projects

!!! warning inline end "Prototype"

    This template is under construction. It has not passed an accessibility audit yet, so currently we do not recommend using it.

!!! quote "Restrictions"

    You can use the MKDocs Tech Docs Template if your service is not considered part of GOV.UK, but your site or service must not:

    - identify itself as being part of GOV.UK
    - use the crown or GOV.UK logotype in the header
    - use the GDS Transport typeface
    - say or suggest that it is an official UK government website if it is not

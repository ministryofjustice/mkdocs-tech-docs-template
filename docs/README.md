    **Mkdocs Tech Docs Template** is a python-based alternative to the ruby-based [Tech Docs Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template) with the following benefits:

    - simple to [setup](./setup/), [customise](./setup/customise.md) and [enhance](./setup/CONTRIBUTE.md)
    - exploits the [MkDocs Materials theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and all it's associated features
    - compatible with the vast ecosystem of MkDocs [plugins](plugins/)
    - unified tech stack for python-based teams and projects

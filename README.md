# MkDocs Tech Docs Template

Build flexible technical documentation with a [GOV.UK style](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Visit the [documentation website](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/mkdocs-tech-docs-template/) for more details.

This template is under construction. It has not passed an accessibility audit yet, so we currently do not recommend using it.
